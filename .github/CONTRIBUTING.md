# Contributing to Swirl
Have an idea for a new feature or enhancement to Swirl?  Find a bug in the code that you can fix?  That's great!  Please read on for guidance around contributing to the project.

## Coding Conventions
 To ensure a proper code review, all contributions to the project must go through a GitHub pull request. We follow a rough approximation of the [Gitflow branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). 
 
 All code contributions should go on the `develop` branch, which helps ensure that our `main` branch remains stable. When submitting PRs to Swirl, please create a branch off of `develop` and fill out the PR Template completely.

For more general information about contributing to projects on Github, visit the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) on this very subject.

## Testing
When submitting a PR, we ask that you please describe in detail how you tested your changes, including details of your testing environment and the tests you ran to validate your change.  Screenshots of working SearchProviders are very helpful, especially if the source you're connecting to is private (not-publicly searchable).

## Docuementation
If your change warrants an update to our existing Product Documentation, or if you are adding a new feature to Swirl, please provide the appropriate documentation content (text and screenshots) as part of your PR.
