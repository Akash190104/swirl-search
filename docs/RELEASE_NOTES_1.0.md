# SWIRL SEARCH 1.0

## Release Notes

:small_blue_diamond: The [Installation Guide](INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md) has been tested for Mac OS/X (Intel, M1) and Centos. It has not been tested on Microsoft Windows.

<br/>

:small_blue_diamond: There are reports that using [OpenSearch](USER_GUIDE.md#using-the-opensearch-interface) sometimes creates two Search objects.

This may be because of browser pre-fetch, or simply because of hitting ENTER twice.<br/>Please report issues with this or the [rerun function](USER_GUIDE.md#re-starting-re-running--re-trying-a-search).

<br/>

:small_blue_diamond: The [Django admin form for managing Result objects](http://localhost:8000/admin/swirl/result/) throws a 500 error. P2.

<br/>

:small_blue_diamond: Watch out for the log files in logs/*.log. They'll need periodic rollover.
