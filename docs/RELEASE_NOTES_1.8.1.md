## Known Issues

:small_blue_diamond: [Creating searches from a browser with q=](https://github.com/sidprobstein/swirl-search/wiki/2.-User-Guide#creating-a-search-object-with-the-q-url-parameter) can sometimes create two Search objects. 

This is because of browser prefetch AKA predictive service. [Turn off Chrome prediction service](https://www.ghacks.net/2019/04/23/missing-chromes-use-a-prediction-service-setting/). [Turn off Safari prefetch](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29214246/how-to-turn-off-safaris-prefetch-feature)
